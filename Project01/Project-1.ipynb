    "<b> The case study assignment has three primary learning objectives:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "* Connecting solid mechanics to vibration fundamentals: This will involve determining the structural stiffness of a simplified wing structure using its geometric and material properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Conducting Systematic structural vibration Analysis: The assignment will guide you through the typical procedure used in structural vibration analysis. You will gain an understanding of the importance of mathematically idealizing complex systems into simplified single-degree-of-freedom (SDoF) and multi-degree-of-freedom (MDoF) models prior to employing advanced finite element method (FEM) tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Realizing the advantages of energy methods over Newtonian mechanics: You will use both Lagrangian and Newtonian mechanics to derive the equations of motion for a wing strucutre as an MDoF system. This will deepen your appreciation of Lagrangian analytical power and versatility.\n",

    "<b> Why Use Jupyter Notebook? </b>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook serves as both a coding and reporting platform, enabling a seamless combination of computation, documentation, and visualization. It encourages clear commentary and explanation of your code in a structured, report-like format.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Expectations:</b>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The project will be submitted as a Jupyter Notebook product. Throughout your notebook, briefly describe your approach, explain the underlying physics of your results. Your submission should reflect both sound technical reasoning and clarity in presentation. Figures without proparly lable axes, grids, title and legends will not be accepted. You will recieve 25 points for completing the assignment tasks on time. You will recieve an extra point for each figure from your model beyond the assignment requirment upto five points. However, you must explain the why you provided the figure with interpretation of your engineering findings.    \n",

    "<b> Background: </b>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The wing of a typical fighter jet, such as the Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star or T-Bird, consists of a lightweight structural airframe with attachment mechanisims at the tip for carrying a mission-related payload or an additional fuel tank attached to the wing tip, denoted as $m_p$. In this case study, you will perform a dynamic analysis of this aircraft wing using various idealized lumped-parameter modeling approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/Approach0.png\" alt=\"Alt text\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "For modeling purposes, the wing may be reasonably approximated as a cantilevered closed-rectagular-cell beam (hollow beam) with a concentrated tip mass. In some tasks you will be asked to assume that the distributed structural mass of the beam, $m_w$ is negligible relative to the tip mass, which is given as $m_p$ = 100 kg. Each wing extends 5.0 m from the fuselage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Idealizing the airfoil closed-rectagular-cell, assume the chord and height remain constant along the span, with values of 0.70 m and 0.25 m, respectively. Accordingly, the beam‚Äôs external cross-sectional area is 0.70 √ó 0.25 m $^2$. A uniform wall thickness of 0.010 m is assumed for the box-beam structure. The wing is fabricated from aluminum alloy 6061-T6. For the purposes of this assignment, the following material properties for aluminum 6061-T6 are obtained from matweb.com: Young‚Äôs modulus, $E$=69 GPa, density $\\rho$=2700‚Äâkg/m $^2$, and Poisson‚Äôs ratio $\\nu$=0.33."
