    "<b> Background: </b>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The wing of a typical fighter jet, such as the Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star or T-Bird, consists of a lightweight structural airframe with attachment mechanisims at the tip for carrying a mission-related payload or an additional fuel tank attached to the wing tip, denoted as $M_1$. Each wing extends 5.0 m from the fuselage. Similar to Case-01, you will estimate the mode shapes and natural frequencies of this aircraft wing using Raleigh’s quotient, beam theory, and FEM. For this assignment, assume the wing is constructed of aluminum 6061-T6 with the following material properties (from matweb.com): Young’s modulus, $E$=69 GPa, density $\\rho$=2700 kg/m $^2$, and Poisson’s ratio $\\nu$=0.33. A typcal vibration ground Test and Evaluation procedure, the wing tip or fuel tank, at $x = L$, are supported by structural elements that can be modeled as linear spring in bending directon $K_{1}$ and a torsional spring $K_t$. The fuel tank can hold a maximum 16 galons (70 kg) of fuel. The tank is modeled as a perfect cylinder with a radius of 0.13 m.\n",

A uniform wall thickness of 0.010 m is assumed for the box-beam structure. Ignore the effect of gravity on these masses.\n",

Masses $M_1$ and $M_2$ were attached to the tip of the wing, $x=l_1+l_2$, and at location x = $l_2$, respectively. The distance $x$ was measured from the fuselage. $M_1$ and $M_2$ polar moments of inertia are $I_{p1}$ and $I_{p2}$, respectively, about an axis perpendicular to the plane of figure below. This time take into account the gravity effect on $M_1$ and $M_2$ only. The springs $K_1$ and $K_2$ are located at $x=l_2$ and $x=l_1+l_2$, respectively.
